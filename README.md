## Speaker Verification (Tensorflow-2)
A Tensorflow-2 Repository containing implementation of DNN architectures
for Speaker Identification/Speaker Verification. The results of the models along with detailed analysis
will be available [here](https://nd15.github.io/nemo/). For the purpose of training and testing
a smaller version of VoxCeleb dataset containing audio samples of only Indian Celebritites is 
used in this project in order to facilitate faster prototyping.

## Models Implemented
- Baseline CNN Model
- Temporal Convolutional Network
- Siamese Capsule Network([Implementation Here](https://github.com/ND15/SiameseSpeech))
- RawNet
- ResDefNet


## Dataset
- [Indian Celeb Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gaurav41/voxceleb1-audio-wav-files-for-india-celebrity)
