## Speaker Recognition (Tensorflow-2)
A Tensorflow-2 Repository containing implementation of DNN architectures
for Speech Recognition/Speaker Verification. The results of the models along with detailed analysis
will be available [here](https://nd15.github.io/nemo/). For the purpose of training and testing
a smaller version of VoxCeleb dataset containing audio samples of only Indian Celebritites is 
used in this project in order to facilitate faster prototyping.
